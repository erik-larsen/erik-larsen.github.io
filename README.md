# emscripten-sdl2-ogles2
*C++/SDL2/OpenGLES2 to Javascript/WebGL using Emscripten*

https://erik-larsen.github.io/

This project is a sample/testbed for porting C++/OpenGL graphical apps to run in the browser.  The motivation for this is to preserve a bunch of old graphics demos written in C/C++.  By getting these demos running in the browser and making them open source, hopefully they can live on for a very long time.  This project is inspired by similar work which uses Emscripten to [preserve arcade games in the browser](https://archive.org/details/internetarcade).
